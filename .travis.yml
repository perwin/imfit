  # OK, the "2.7_with_system_site_packages" sort of works, except that importing numpy fails due to Unicode 
  # incompatibilities between Travis Python 2.7 and the numpy library in 2.7_with_system_site_packages

  # the following seems to work, but numpy isn't available for some reason
  #- "3.4_with_system_site_packages"

# Python stuff so we can run python-using scripts in regression tests. The following
# actually works. For Python 2.7, it adds about 30s to the build time (for installing pyfits, 
# because pip detects that numpy is already installed[?!]); if we use Python 3.4, it adds about 
# 3 minutes (needs to install numpy as well as pyfits)
install:

  - pip install pyfits

  - scons imfit

# Note that running do_imfit_tests tends to produce the usual Linux-vs-OSX output mismatches
# in the final decimal places for some of the outputs (probably due to subtle
# floating-point issues), and sometimes mysterious segfaults.
# Also, do_makeimage_tests finds image mismatches for the oversampled PSF case which
# don't appear on OS X.
